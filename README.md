# teensyOAV
 A port of the OpenAeroVtol project from the KK2 flight controller to the Teensy 4.0

To Do: A lot!!
1)Parts list
2)Schematic
3)Arduino build instructions
4)PPM Receiver Implementation (maybe)
5)Battery monitoring
6)Cleanup failsafe/disarm code
7)General code cleanup, it's pretty messy, can probably be simplfied
8)Whatever I forgot....
